/**
 * @class ListeningSocketHandler
 * 
 * The `ListeningSocketHandler` class manages the listening sockets used by the web server. It is responsible 
 * for adding, storing, and cleaning up listening sockets, which are used to accept incoming client connections.
 * It also maintains a mapping of listening sockets based on their host and port combination.
 * 
 * - **Socket Management**: The class handles the creation and management of multiple listening sockets, 
 *   allowing the server to listen for incoming connections on various host-port combinations.
 * 
 * - **Socket Collection**: It stores a collection of listening sockets in a vector and maps them to a specific 
 *   host and port in a map, providing efficient lookup and management.
 * 
 * - **Server Initialization**: The handler is responsible for initializing listening sockets based on the provided 
 *   server configuration, associating them with the appropriate servers.
 * 
 * - **Cleanup**: The class provides a method to clean up all the listening sockets when the server shuts down, 
 *   ensuring resources are properly released.
 * 
 * This class is a central component in the serverâ€™s networking infrastructure, enabling it to listen for and 
 * manage incoming client connections on multiple sockets.
