/**
 * @class HttpResponse
 * 
 * The `HttpResponse` class is responsible for constructing and representing an HTTP response that will be sent by webserver. 
 * It allows setting and managing the various components of an HTTP response, such as the status code, 
 * reason phrase, headers, and body content. This class is used to generate the response in the proper 
 * format before sending it to the client.
 * 
 * - **Response Construction**: The class provides methods to set the HTTP status code, reason phrase, 
 *   headers, and body, allowing the server to generate responses according to the HTTP protocol.
 * 
 * - **Content Management**: It manages the response body and headers, including the ability to set and 
 *   retrieve headers, which are critical for HTTP communication.
 * 
 * - **Response Formatting**: The class includes a method to convert the response into a valid HTTP format 
 *   for transmission over the network.
 * 
 * This class is a key component in the web serverâ€™s ability to send properly structured HTTP responses 
 * to clients, ensuring the server communicates effectively with the requesting client.
